# $$Credit \space Card \space Customer \space Segmentation$$

This project explores unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment credit card customers based on their spending habits. 

**Project Goals:**

* Identify distinct customer groups with similar spending patterns. 
* Develop a comprehensive notebook for educational purposes.

**Content:**

* **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Analyze and prepare the credit card transaction data for modeling.
* **Clustering Algorithms:** 
    * Implement K-Means clustering to identify natural customer segments.
    * Explore techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, Gap Statistic).
    * Apply Hierarchical clustering for a top-down approach to uncover group structure.
    * Utilize DBSCAN to identify clusters of arbitrary shapes, handling potential outliers.
    * Leverage Gaussian Mixture Models (EM) to model customer behavior using probability distributions.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    * Employ T-SNE for visualization of high-dimensional data for clearer insights.
    * Implement PCA to capture the most significant variations within the data.
    * Utilize Kernel PCA to uncover non-linear relationships for more effective clustering.
* **Cluster Evaluation:** Assess the quality of the formed clusters using various methods.

**Learning Outcomes:**

This project provides a hands-on exploration of unsupervised machine learning techniques for customer segmentation. The accompanying notebook serves as a detailed guide, explaining each step from data wrangling to algorithm selection and result interpretation.

**Additional Information:**

* Feel free to reach out with any questions about the project or the notebook.
